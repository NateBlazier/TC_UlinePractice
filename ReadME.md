Get comfortable with Name Mapping: Learn how to identify, edit, and alias objects.


Stick with scripting (JavaScript): Use your strength—skip keywords unless needed.


Practice data-driven tests: These are easy wins in TC and useful in most test cases.


Explore logs + screenshots: Great for debugging and test reviews.


Try exporting a test and running it via TestExecute (CI/CD style).
